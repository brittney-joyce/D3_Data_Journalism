<h1> Data Journalism and D3 <h1>

<p>For this assignment we earned a role doing data visualizations at a major metro newspaper. </p>
<p> We have created data visualization with D3 using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. Our objective was to find correlation between two data variables measured per state. This data was found through U.S. Census Bureau and the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System. </p>

<p>The data I analyzed was the correlation of state population with a bachelor's degree to income of $50,000+. </p>

<p> Interesting finds were:
<li>1. Washington DC appears to be quite an outlier with both a high population with a bachelor degree and also earning a high income.</li>
<li> Maryland appears to have the highest populaton percentage with an income of at least $50,000.</li>
<li> A cluster of states appear to have an income between $35k to $45k with bout 25-30% of the population having bachelor degrees.
